# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analyst  
  
This repository contains the solution for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise for the Data Analyst position. The main objective of this exercise is to demonstrate the ability to reason about data, create a structured relational data model, write SQL queries to answer business questions, evaluate data quality issues, and communicate effectively with stakeholders.
