This query first creates two CTEs (recent_month_receipts and previous_month_receipts) to filter the receipts scanned in the recent month and the previous month. Then, it creates a CTE called receipt_items_with_brands to join the Receipt_Items table with the Brands table using the barcode. Next, it creates two separate CTEs (recent_month_ranking and previous_month_ranking) to calculate the number of receipts scanned for each brand in the recent month and the previous month. After that, it creates two more CTEs (recent_month_top_5 and previous_month_top_5) to rank the brands by the number of receipts scanned in each month. Finally, it joins the recent_month_top_5 and previous_month_top_5 CTEs on the brand_id and selects the brand_id, brand_name, recent_month_rank, and previous_month_rank, ordering the results by the recent_month_rank.
