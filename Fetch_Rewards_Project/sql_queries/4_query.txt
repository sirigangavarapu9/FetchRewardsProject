This query first creates a CTE called accepted_rejected_receipts to filter the receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus' of 'Accepted' or 'Rejected'. Then, it creates another CTE called receipt_items_count to calculate the total number of items purchased for each receipt. Finally, it joins the Receipts table with the receipt_items_count CTE on the receipt_id and selects the rewards_receipt_status and the total number of items purchased for each status, grouping the results by rewards_receipt_status. The output will show the total number of items purchased for both 'Accepted' and 'Rejected' statuses, allowing you to compare which one is greater.
