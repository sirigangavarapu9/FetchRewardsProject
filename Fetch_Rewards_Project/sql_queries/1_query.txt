This query first creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) called recent_month_receipts to filter the receipts scanned in the most recent month. Then, it creates another CTE called receipt_items_with_brands to join the Receipt_Items table with the Brands table using the barcode. Finally, it selects the top 5 brands by counting the number of receipts scanned for each brand, ordering the results in descending order, and limiting the output to 5 rows.
