This query first creates a CTE called recent_users to filter the users who were created within the past 6 months. Then, it creates another CTE called recent_user_receipts to join the Receipts table with the Receipt_Items table and calculate the total spend for each item in the receipts. Next, it creates a CTE called receipt_items_with_brands to join the recent_user_receipts CTE with the Brands table using the barcode. Finally, it selects the brand_id, brand_name, and the total spend for each brand, grouping the results by brand_id and brand_name, ordering the results by total spend in descending order, and limiting the output to 1 row to get the brand with the most spend.
